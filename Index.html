		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>Valorant is a free-to-play first-person tactical hero shooter developed and published by Riot Games. It is a team-based first-person tactical hero shooter set in the near future. Players play as one of a set of Agents, characters based on several countries and cultures around the world. In the main game mode, players are assigned to either the attacking or defending team with each team having five players on it. Agents have unique abilities, each requiring charges, as well as a unique ultimate ability that requires charging through kills, deaths, "Ultimate Orb", or completing objectives. Every player starts each round with a "Classic" pistol and one or more "Signature ability" charges. Other weapons and ability charges can be purchased using an in-game economic system that awards money based on the outcome of the previous round, any kills the player is responsible for, and any objectives completed. The game has an assortment of weapons including secondary sidearms and primary guns like SMGs, shotguns, machine guns, assault rifles and sniper rifles. There are automatic and semi-automatic weapons that each have a unique shooting pattern that has to be controlled by the player to be able to shoot accurately. It currently offers 25 agents to choose from.</p>

		<h2>Map layout and Agent Pool/selection</h2>
		<p>Each Map in Valorant has 2 or 3 sites, which you either have to attack and plant the Spike, or defend the site from the Attackers. There are multiple routes you can take to get onto a site. Let's use the first map on Valorant as an example, Haven(the map below). The space labeled as "Defenders" and "Attackers" are the spawn areas for your team, there are 3 bombsites, A, B and C, in alphabetical order from the Defenders POV. There are multiple ways to get onto these bombsites for the attackers to plant the bomb, named the Spike. There is also a middle lane, shortened to Mid. The other labels for the other parts of the map are the names of the callouts where you might see the enemy.<br>Now onto the Agent pool.There are 25 different agents for you to choose from, each with their specific roles and abilities. When you first begin playing the game, you will have 5 agents to start with. There are a 4 different roles in Valorant, named "Initiator", "Duelist", "Sentinel" and "Controller". The initiator role helps the team to gather information about the enemy's position, with different abilities to gather this information. We shall use the first initiator you will be able to play, Sova. He has the ability to shoot an arrow that can seek out enemies' locations. Most other initiators also have the ability to flashbang the enemy, which stuns and blinds the enemy. The duelist is the role that has abilities to take space in the map for their teammates and be an entry fragger, otherwise known as the person who opens up the site and kills the enemy easily. Each duelist has abilities to take space within the map and give them the advantage in a 1v1 duel. The sentinel is a role that can cover your flanks and hold down a site to prevent the enemy team from getting onto the site. Each sentinel has abilities to stop the enemy from getting onto site, whether if it is a tripwire that catches enemies and stuns them, and creates an outline of their character or a wall to block off the enemy.</p>
